            <P>i am monisha akter asha .There are a lot of things to explore in a person which can be written in a
                “Paragraph on Myself”. It is a common topic in the witting section that students need to answer in the
                examination. It is such a topic on which students can express everything about themselves like their
                views, hobbies, and plan. There are some short and long paragraphs on Myself for students. </P>
